# W3Schools JavaScript Certification Study Guide 

A guide for learning and understanding the main concepts of JavaScript for web development in order to ace the certification exam.
 
## Details

As part of the Generation USA Web Developer program, we were given the opportunity to take the W3Schools JavaScript Certification Exam as a sign of completion of the course. Our teachers gave us a study guide to work collaboratively as a class to fill in all the answers to the guide. The class did a pretty good job completing the guide, but because it was a combined effort of several classmates who filled out the guide, it was hard to read in my opinion and I would also assume that my fellow classmates who were a lot newer to JavaScript would have a hard time going over the material.

So I took the opportunity to create a 'better' version of the study guide. I basically made a copy of the document and erased all the answers and started from scratch. I filled in all the answers to each question, while trying to provide my own insights where I felt were needed, and also tried to have fun along the way by adding some small humor here and there. With most of the answers, I also took the liberty to add code blocks to provide a visual representation of how each concept would look like in action. 

I hope my classmates find this helpful, and I've added both .DOCX and .PDF formats.
